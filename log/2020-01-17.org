This week was too busy for any useful free time at all. Today I did finish all the recordings of the 2019 edition of DerbyCon on my commute. It has many interesting talks, but also the community aspect of the con sounds amazing. It was unfortunately also the last DerbyCon, but they do allow the community to continue with the ideas and the spirit of DerbyCon, which I thought was really cool and special.
